        <h2>How To Feed Yourself</h2>

<p>This guide will be a general how-to for bachelors who want to make something simple and tasty for themselves on a regular basis. I'll be drawing on my years of experience in professional and personal kitchens, as well as the following resources:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Best Recipe Cookbook</em> by America's Test Kitchen</li>
<li>
<em>In Search of Perfection</em> by Heston Blumenthal</li>
<li>
<em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> by Julia Child</li>
<li>Episodes the show <em>Good Eats</em>, created by Alton Brown.</li>
</ul><p>While techniques from these creators may be paraphrased or quoted, the recipes provided herein will be my original creations. Why?</p>

<ol>
<li>Others' recipes may be obtained legitimately from the original publishers.</li>
<li>Most of the original recipes don't scale well to single portions.</li>
<li> I may occasionally use a particular sort of item--like jar sauce instead of home-made--that short-cuts the process without sacrificing too much food value. You will likely not see this in any recipe from the chefs listed above.</li>
<li> Chefs almost never list what tools to use in a recipe. I will.</li>
</ol><hr><p>Please note also that in my equipment lists, I have no qualms about supporting particular products and brands. I will provide a prioritized list of tools that you'll definitely want all the way down to items that are simply nice to have.</p>

<p>I hope that this guide will be of some use to those of you looking to enjoy a diverse, potentially quite healthy diet without having to do a ton of work. May you enjoy eating as much as I do, and thank you for your kind attention.</p>

<h4>P.S.</h4>

<p>If you have a problem with any of the equipment, techniques or recipes provided or if anything is unclear, please submit it to the "Issues" section.</p>
