#### How To Feed Yourself
This guide will be a general how-to for bachelors who want to make something simple and tasty for themselves on a regular basis. I'll be drawing on my years of experience in professional and personal kitchens, as well as the following resources:

_Best Recipe Cookbook_ by America's Test Kitchen
_In Seach of Perfection_ by Heston Blumenthal
_Mastering the Art of French Cooking_ by Julia Child

As well as episodes the show _Good Eats_, created by Alton Brown.

While techniques from these creators may be paraphased or quoted, the recipes provided herein will be my original creations. Why?

 1. Thier recipes may be obtained ligitimately from the original publishers.
 2. Most of the original recipes don't scale well to single portions.
 3. I may occasionally use a paricular sort of item--like jar sauce instead of home-made--that short-cuts the process without sacrificing too much food value. You will likely not see this in any recipe from the chefs listed above.

Please note also that in my equipment lists, I have no qualms about supporting particular products and brands. I will provide a prioritized list of tools that you'll definitely want all the way down to items that are simply nice to have.

I hope that this guide will be of some use to those of you looking to enjoy a diverse, potentially quite healthy diet without having to do a ton of work. May you enjoy eating as much as I do, and thank you for your kind attention.
