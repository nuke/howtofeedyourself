{"name":"How to Feed Yourself","body":"## How To Feed Yourself \r\nThis guide will be a general how-to for bachelors who want to make something simple and tasty for themselves on a regular basis. I'll be drawing on my years of experience in professional and personal kitchens, as well as the following resources:\r\n\r\n* _Best Recipe Cookbook_ by America's Test Kitchen\r\n* _In Search of Perfection_ by Heston Blumenthal\r\n* _Mastering the Art of French Cooking_ by Julia Child\r\n* Episodes the show _Good Eats_, created by Alton Brown.\r\n\r\nWhile techniques from these creators may be paraphrased or quoted, the recipes provided herein will be my original creations. Why?\r\n\r\n1. Others' recipes may be obtained legitimately from the original publishers.\r\n2. Most of the original recipes don't scale well to single portions.\r\n3.  I may occasionally use a particular sort of item--like jar sauce instead of home-made--that short-cuts the process without sacrificing too much food value. You will likely not see this in any recipe from the chefs listed above.\r\n4.  Chefs almost never list what tools to use in a recipe. I will.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nPlease note also that in my equipment lists, I have no qualms about supporting particular products and brands. I will provide a prioritized list of tools that you'll definitely want all the way down to items that are simply nice to have.\r\n\r\nI hope that this guide will be of some use to those of you looking to enjoy a diverse, potentially quite healthy diet without having to do a ton of work. May you enjoy eating as much as I do, and thank you for your kind attention.\r\n\r\n#### P.S.\r\nIf you have a problem with any of the equipment, techniques or recipes provided or if anything is unclear, please submit it to the \"Issues\" section.\r\n\r\n#### P.P.S.\r\nThe formatting on this was forked it from [newman](https://github.com/newman).
