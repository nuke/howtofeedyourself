#### Omelet (Done in the French style)

Omelets are a wonderful sort of thing to prepare when you don't have a lot of time or energy to throw much together, but you can take them further with your fillings as well. According to Juila Child, omelets are a first course dish in France, and not just for breakfast.

Shredded cheese and precooked meat are always excellent choices to add for a filled omelet, but any miscellaneous sauce or cooked vegetables you have leftover will generally work as well. Of course, they're usually a savory item and not a sweet one, so you may want to avoid strange fillings like chocolate or fruit.

1 Serving

Ingredients:

* 2-3 Extra Large or Jumbo Eggs
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* Optional: 
 * Salt and Pepper to Taste
 * Heated Filling (Microwave or stove-top)

Tools:

* Small Bowl
* Fork or Whisk
* Teaspoon
* Fry Pan
* Knife
* Silicone Spatula
* Warm Ceramic Plate -- (Warm it in the oven or 'dry' setting on your dishwasher)

## Preparation
 1. Crack each egg against a flat surface so as to discourage your shells from getting in the egg. If you haven't practiced this often, pull the two parts of the egg apart carefully above the bowl. Fish out any shell with the spoon as you go. You may add salt and pepper at this point. Beat the eggs with your fork or whisk until the yolks have all broken and mixed with the clear whites. There will still be some separation.
 2. Place your pan over medium or  medium-high heat and put in your oil and butter. Be ready with the eggs. Your pan is hot enough when the butter stops foaming up. There will still be some bubbles. (It's possible, but tricky, to time this so that the pan is heating while you prepare the eggs.)
 3. This is the point right before the butter starts to brown, so add the eggs immediately. Shake the pan in little circles as you pour, being careful not to splash oil in the process. The eggs should sizzle and pockets of steam will make them float on top of the oil, not sticking as long as they stay in motion.
 4. You now have two options: 

  a. Shake the pan in circles, then forwards and back. You can use this chance to practice your flipping technique to flip the omelet around itself until you get a sort of pointed cylinder. Alternately, you may use a silicone spatula to gently fold the egg around itself, sliding it carefully under the edge. Please note that carry-over cooking will take the inside of the egg the rest of the way. Do not let it brown on the outside. Any uncooked egg in the center will turn into a smooth custard. It should not be slimy.

  b. You may instead shake the pan in circles until a large disk is formed and the egg is mostly cooked through. Place your hot filling in the center and gently fold either side of the egg over it to form a burrito shape. The custardy inside of the egg will still cook after it leaves the pan as long as your filling is hot as well.

 5. Shake the egg down to the side of the pan opposite the handle. The long side of the omelet should be perpendicular to the pan handle. To unmold, grab the handle of your pan (with a potholder, if necessary) from the *underside*. Bring the palm of your hand up to the underside of the handle, thumb pointed outward, and grip the handle firmly.  If your plate is hot, also hold it with a potholder or kitchen towel. Place the lip that is opposite the pan handle against the plate and flip the pan upside-down on the lip's axis.

This process should take no more than five minutes. Everything goes very quickly, and the detail in these instructions should help prevent you from making any clear mistakes. Even so, you'll have to do quite a few before you find they come out just right. Please don't be discouraged if your results aren't perfect the first time, as any egg dish tends to be a bit unforgiving.
